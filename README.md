# Prettier Config

Prettier Config used in projects developed by NewCeptionDev

## Installation

Install the package via npm:
> npm install --save-dev --save-exact

I would recommend using the ***--save-exact*** addition when installing the package to make sure, that the config won't change without your intention to do so.

After installing the package include it by setting it in your *package.json* or extending your own prettier config.<br>
See the [Prettier Guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#sharing-configurations) for more information.

## Usage

After including the config you can run prettier by using:
> prettier --write .

To include Prettier into your IDE setup, have a look at [Prettier Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).
